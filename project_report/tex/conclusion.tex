Here you need to summarize what you did and why this is
important. Do not take the abstract and put it in the past
tense. Remember, now the reader has (hopefully) read the
paper, so it is a very different situation from the abstract.
Try to highlight important results and say the things you really
want to get across such as high-level statements (e.g.,
we believe that .... is the right approach to .... Even though
we only considered LAN, the .... technique should be applicable
....) You can also formulate next steps if you want.
Be brief.
