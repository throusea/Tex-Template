    \ldots when Einstein introduced his formula
    \begin{equation}
        e = m \cdot c^2 \; ,
    \end{equation}
    which is at the same time the most widely known 
    and the least well understood physical formula

    
    \ldots from which follows Kirchoff's current law:
    \begin{equation}
        \sum_{k=1}^{n} I_k = 0 \; .
    \end{equation}
    Kirchhoff's voltage law can be derived \ldots

    \ldots which has several advantages.
    \begin{equation}
        I_D = I_F - I_R
    \end{equation}
    is the core of a very different transistor model. \ldots
